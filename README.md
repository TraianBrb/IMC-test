# Inside Media Communication

Inside Media Communication Practical Test

## IMC Requirements for development

[hidden]

## Getting Started

The Build folder contains HTML, CSS, JS and images files which were generated from Source folder using gulp.
The Source folder contains pug, sass, JS and images.

*The HTML and CSS files are 100% readable, **but** I highly recommend reading the Source files: .pug and .scss*

### Prerequisites

You need to install node.js & npm

### Installing

From the root directory (where package.json is located), open the terminal and run

```
npm i
```

## Running

Run in terminal

```
gulp
```

It should open the IMC page in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
Now you are using gulp and browsersync.

For more information check gulpfile.js file.

### Choices made throughout development

In styling the page, I used:

* Flexbox
```
display: flex;
```

* [Slick.js](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) for creating the Hero Carousel.

* Placeholders for 2nd and 3rd slide are generated by [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

* 'postcss-responsive-type' NPM for making font-size responsive.

* 'postcss-easy-media-query' NPM for media queries.

* Mobile-version header will hide when scrolling down and show when scrolling up.

* Mobile-version footer lists were wrapped in accordions.

* Most images are .svg and were optimized through [SvgOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).

* **The page was deployed using Surge and you can check it [here](http://imc-traianbarbu.surge.sh/)**
